## Submitting your changes

Once your changes and tests are ready to submit for review:

1. Test your changes

    Run the test suite to make sure that nothing is broken. (comming soon)

1. Rebase your changes

    Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main LDTS CRM repository, and rebase your branch on top of the latest master branch.

    Push your local changes to your forked copy of the repository and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). In the pull request, choose a title which sums up the changes that you have made, and in the body provide more details about what your changes do.
